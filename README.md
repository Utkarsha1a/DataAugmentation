# DataAugmentation

Image data augmentation is a technique that can be used to expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset.

**Why Data Augmentation is important**

The performance of deep learning neural networks often improves with the amount of data available.Training deep learning neural network models on more data can result in more skillful models, and the augmentation techniques can create variations of the images that can improve the ability of the fit models to generalize what they have learned to new images.

Transforms include a range of operations from the field of image manipulation, such as shifts, flips, zooms, and much more.

*CNN can learn features that are invariant to their location in the image. Nevertheless, augmentation can further aid in this transform invariant approach to learning and can aid the model in learning features that are also invariant to transforms such as left-to-right to top-to-bottom ordering, light levels in photographs, and more.*

**We will see the use shift, flip, brightness, and zoom image data augmentation using Keras in this repository**
